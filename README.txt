my "website" has an index page with links to the "about" page as well as a player that plays and visualizes (using FFT) 
a sample of my capstone with a couple parameters/interactions (volume, playback rate, and pan, which are controlled
with sliders, and BPF and LPF that can be controlled by mousing over the canvas (frequency on the X and width/resonance
on the Y))
i've had a bit of trouble getting the BPFilter to work in an optimal way, but i'd say the sweet spot vertically speaking
is if you hover over the text (and let me know if you have any suggestions on how to improve it)
