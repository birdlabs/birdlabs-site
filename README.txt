my "website" has an index page with links to the "about" page as well as a player that plays and visualizes (using FFT) 
a sample of my capstone with a couple parameters/interactions (volume, playback rate, and pan, which are controlled
with sliders, and BPF and LPF that can be controlled by mousing over the canvas (frequency on the X and width/resonance
on the Y))
